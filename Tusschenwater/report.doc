Pilot CO2 uptake rewetting measures Hunzedal

Weier Liu, Merijn Slagter, Christian Fritz

Introduction (Merijn)

Rewetting measures have been taken or are planned in different areas in 'Het Hunzedal'. Rewetting former agriculture may reduce GHG emissions. 

In this project, we quantify the emission reduction that:
- already took place in rewetted areas in the past
- is projected to take place in the future (till 2050)

The focus is on three areas:
- Tusschenwater (currently rewetted)
- LOFAR (rewetted in late 1990's)
- Zoersche Landen (rewetted in late 2000's)

Methods (Weier)

Intermediate Results - see annex (Weier)

Rewetted: 13056.75 tons in 149 ha
BAU: 105290.2 tons in 146.75 ha

Next steps (Merijn)

Our next steps:
Implementation of subsidence rates of peat in the scenario analysis of Tusschenwater
Building GHG reduction models for Zoersche Landen and LOFAR
Update for GWP

Before we can continue our project, we need some more data (see attachment for our data question)
